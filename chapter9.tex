\item[Graphical Approaches] Boxplot, Scatter plot, Spin plot
\item[Statistical Approaches] points are determined to be outliers depending on their relationship with this model
\item[Nearest Neighbor Based Approaches] Distance based methods or density based methods
\item[Classification Based Approaches] Supervised learning techniques
